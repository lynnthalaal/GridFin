# GridFin

This is the python code I used during my research project for university which involved using motors to control some 
lattice tail fins of a rocket model.

# Project Description

The project included manufacturing a rocket model, test stand and tail fins in order to carry out wind tunnel testing
and assess the drag force and wind movement around the fins. The fins were made through 3D printing after modelling them on
SolidWorks and the rocket model and test stand were machined in the university manufacturing lab.

Several lattice fin designs were tested and the models were based on the fins used by SpaceX's Falcon 9 and the Soyuz emergency
escape vehicle.

## Wiring

This is the wiring diagram for how the stepper motors were connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins via a ULN2003 Driver Board.
